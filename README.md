# chest-x-ray-model-deep-learning

This project can be seen in two phases:

Phase 1

A deep learning model is trained which trains a model using transfer learning in an attempt to identify one or more existing conditions existing in a Chest X Ray.

This model is then exported to a .tar.gz file which is also made available in the repository.


Phase 2

The machine learning model is hosted on an AWS Lambda environment. This is available under lambda-multilabel.
